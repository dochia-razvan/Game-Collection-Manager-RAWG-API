# Game-Collection-Manager-RAWG-API
A web-based platform designed for users who want to organize and track their personal game collection. The application allows users to add new games, update details such as playtime, completion status, and personal ratings, remove games from their collection and more.

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Thymeleaf. The backend is implemented in Java with Spring Boot, utilizing JPA for database management and authentication mechanisms. The database is managed using a relational database system, and RESTful APIs facilitate communication between the frontend and backend components.

The application uses the RAWG API which provides detailed information about video games. Users can search for games using keywords, and the application fetches game-related metadata such as title, genre, platforms, Metacritic score, release date and more.
